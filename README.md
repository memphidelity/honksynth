Web Audio API Synthesizer

This is my firsst attempt at JavaScript. It is based on a simplification of the modular synthesizer and uses the oscillator, gain, and filter capabilities of the API. The current iteration is hanging up on iOS Safari. The next step is to integrated the MIDI API and hook up a controller.
